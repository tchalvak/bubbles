A different way to check in with people

We all have invisible needs as humans.  We often ask each-other "how are you doing?" but the responses and the ability to articulate a meaningful response leaves much to be desired.  Children or others not especially in touch with their emotions or not used to communicating emotion may have issues answering the question "How are you feeling?"
Your kid or partner may answer with "Good." Or "Fine." but are they really?  Is that good enough for you!
What about checking out myself? I may feel a certain way on July 5th, and differently on September 20th, how do I remember what it meant to feel fine in July?

So this is a simple check-in to fill out the bubbles of:
- human touch
- emotions
- conversation
- things done for me
- I feel valued
- my tools/toys 
- my free time
